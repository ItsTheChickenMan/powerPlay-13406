# todo

A todolist of every bug that needs fixing that couldn't be fit into the code somewhere because it's too broad

- Figure out why ArmStressTest.java is about 4 degrees to high when returning the elbow to 0 degrees
  - Could apply to other files but does not seem to happen in AbeManual.java for some reason, even after heavy stress?
- Figure out why getExtension doesn't work for LinearSlides.java
  - setExtension still does?
- Add asin -> atan fix to notebook
