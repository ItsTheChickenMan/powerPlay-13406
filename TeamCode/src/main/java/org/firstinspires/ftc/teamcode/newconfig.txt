Nothing is built yet, but redesign hardware is looking like:

-shoulder (same as previous elbow, just renamed)
-slides (down a stage, RPM probably lower to 312)
-elbow (this time at the end of the slides, actuating an arm of static length (probably a few inches longer than single slide stage))
-wrist (at the end of the elbow, holds flipper and serves same purpose as before)
-flipper (at the end of wrist, holds claw and flips it around to hold cone properly)
-claw (at end of flipper, same as previous claw)

With a cycle looking like:
-claw grabs from behind
-(after driver selects junction) drivetrain aims, shoulder goes to angle
-(after driver indicates) slides extend, elbow moves, flipper flips (depending on aim style), wrist goes to high angle
-(after driver indicates) wrist moves down
-(after driver indicates) cone drops, slides move down and elbow moves back once slides are close enough (maybe some hardware enhancements so elbow can move back sooner?)

Code notes:
-drivetrain math should be the exact same
-arm math changes a bit but is fairly trivial.  still using the same math as before to determine how far and high the arm needs to aim, but there's more to actuate
	-hardest part is that there are multiple solutions to aim at a single point, vs. previous arm only having one.  choosing a solution should probably be based on what requires the least movement from the slowest part
-teleop and auto need a better framework, last one was rushed and was impossible to work with
-need more organization going forward
