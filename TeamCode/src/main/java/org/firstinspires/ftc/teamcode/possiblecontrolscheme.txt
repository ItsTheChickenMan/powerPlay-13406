Stages:

Aim stage (g1):
    -Drive stick
    -Slow stick

Grab stage (g1):
    -Drive stick
    -Slow stick

Aim stage (g2):
    ~Joystick for aiming
    ~Single button for "locking" to a junction (note: single status LED on bot to indicate status in these scenarios?)
    ~Button/Trigger for extending to junction
    ~Button for depositing
    -Joystick for tuning (should only be allowed during extension)
    -Something for height adjustment? Need a system to possibly "score on top" of other bots
        -Possibly a button that toggles between low and high (low being normal height of keeping cone bottom ~1 inch from top of pole, and high keeping it ~6 inches from top of pole)

Grab stage (g2):
    -Joystick for aiming (controls raw rotation rather than aim at point)
    ~Button for grabbing
    -Button(s) for adjusting wrist (for picking up lopsided cones)
    -Joystick/trigger for slides?  I'm a little worried about giving manual slide control, since it seems to totally screw up the encoders, but there might be a way around it
    -dpad for stack adjustment (bot will try to figure this out on its own, but if it's wrong this is for changing which cone it tries)
